          hit-and-run, is also among its most under-investigated. Shaded here from <span class="legendary blue1">1</span> to <span class="legendary blue5">80 or more</span> incidents, they were most prominent on the North Side and in Uptown from 2015 through Feb. 3, 2020. Only a small fraction of reports led to <span class="dot arrest"></span> arrests.</div>
